  <h5>Overview</h5>
  <p>Our primary goal for this project was to create a novel interface that augments 
    in-person and/or remote communication and collaboration. In pursuit of this objective
    and in response to the increasing trend of remote work among companies, we have developed
    an innovative interface aimed at recreating the essence of an in-person office environment.
    Our interface is designed to bridge the physical gap between remote employees, fostering a 
    sense of connection and presence as if they were co-located in an office setting. Through this
    platform, employees can visualize and interact with their colleagues virtually, mimicking the
    experience of being in the same physical space.
</p>
  <h5>Interface Logic</h5>
    <p>
    Our interface operates on a virtual office concept, providing users with a dynamic representation of a shared workspace. Employees can access this interface through a web or application-based platform. Initially, each employee must create a personalized account on CoWork Central, setting up their profile with their preferred name, pronouns, and selecting an avatar to represent them in the virtual workplace. Subsequently, they can log in using their name and company email.

    
    <p>
    The system utilizes real-time data to display the status of each individual within the virtual office – whether they are seated at their desks, in a meeting, on a lunch break, away from their station, or engaged in specific activities like using the washroom. When an employee is present at their office space, a flashing green light indicates their availability, while an absent or unavailable employee is indicated by a flashing red light near their office, denoting their unavailability.

    </p>
    <p>
    Users navigate through this virtual office, represented as a map or floor plan, with the ability to move freely across the space. As employees move closer to each other within the virtual office, audio-visual communication tools are activated, allowing for seamless interaction. This proximity-based communication feature creates an organic and natural way for employees to engage in conversations or collaborate as if they were physically co-located.

    </p>
 
  <h5>Initial 10 Sketches</h5>
  <p>Each team member was asked to sketch out 10 ideas that they believe could be suitable for an innovative and 
   novel interface. We then discussed each idea thoroughly and brainstormed new 
    features that could be added to the original idea. At the end, we decided that “CoWork Central” is 
    the idea that best suits the project’s rubric and has the most prospects for success while being implementable 
    given the short timeline.
</p>

  <h5>Refined 10 Sketches</h5>
  <p>After agreeing that the “CoWork Central” idea had the most prospect for innovation and success, each 
    team member created 10 refined sketches that matched their vision of the smart system. We then discussed all 
    the designs, and decided on the feasible features of the system that could be implemented given our short timeline.

    <li>System detects light intensity and determines if it is sufficient for healthy growth.</li>
    <li>System detects the room temperature and determines if it is ideal.</li>
    <li>If the surrounding environmental conditions are satisfactory, an LED will flash.</li>
    <li>If the system detects that the moisture level in th esoil is low, it waters the plant.</li>
    <li>The system will move the plant until an ideal position is found.</li>
    <li>If the system detects that either the temperature or humidity is too high, the systems switches on a fan that is directed towards the plant.</li>
    <li>If the surrounding environmental conditions are unsatisfactory, the system will display the unmet requirements. Otherwise it will display that the environmental conditions are satisfactory.</li>
    <li>If the surrounding environmental conditions are satisfactory, the system will make a loud noise.</li>
    <li>If the light intensity is determined to be too low, the system powers several LEDs.</li>
    <li>System detects the moisture level in soil and determines if it is sufficient or excessive.</li>
  </ol>
  

  <h5>What makes our interface special?</h5>

  <p>
   The primary goal of this interface is to foster a profound sense of connection and collaboration among dispersed teams, recreating the ambiance, natural interactions and spontaneous encounters typically found within a physical office setting. 

  </p>
  <p>Key features that contribute to the interface’s uniqueness:</p>
    
  <p>
   1. Real-time Presence and Activity Tracking: 
Our interface provides a comprehensive view of employees' activities, allowing remote workers to observe who is actively present at their desk, who is on a lunch break, using the washroom, or engaged in other activities within the virtual office space. This real-time presence tracking creates a sense of shared workspace despite physical distance.

</p>

  <p>2. Immersive Virtual Office Experience: The platform offers a visually immersive environment, enabling users to explore and navigate the virtual office space freely.  The freedom of moving from one area to another promotes a more engaging and seamless experience that mimics the spontaneity and fluidity of walking around a physical office.
</p>
   <p>3. Proximity-Based Communication: By enabling communication based on virtual proximity, the interface replicates natural, spontaneous conversations, promoting collaboration and a sense of togetherness among remote employees.
</p>
   <p>4. User-Friendly Navigation: The interface is designed with an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing for easy navigation and interaction within the virtual office environment.</p>

  <p>In summary, our interface redefines the remote work landscape by bridging the gap between physical separation and a cohesive, shared workspace experience through a virtual office setting that goes beyond conventional video conferencing tools. By replicating the dynamics of an in-person office setting, the interface offers an  interactive and inclusive platform that fosters a sense of belonging and connection among remote employees that would eventually enhance productivity within distributed teams.
</p>
  <h5>Project contribution:</h5>
  <p>Our team's success in this project was the result of a coordinated effort, with each member playing a crucial role. When it came to sketching out our initial ideas, each team member prepared their own ideas, then we brainstormed, refined, and collaborated to bring our creative visions to life. Nayera meticulously transformed our sketches into a functioning and engaging interface whereas Hala crafted and developed the animation and images employed. Nayera’s writing skills allowed the team to present informative write-ups that effectively communicated the essence of our project. For the concept video and demo, Hala brought the interface to life with her enthusiasm and acting skills. Together, we combined our strengths and talents to deliver an innovative and engaging application in a short period of time.
