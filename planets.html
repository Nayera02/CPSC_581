  <h5>Overview</h5>
  <p>Our primary goal for this project was to design and implement an 
    animated touch-based interface for a mobile phone that provides an 
    alternative way to unlock a mobile phone equipped with a multi-touch 
    display. In pursuit of this objective, we designed a more secure and 
    engaging mobile phone unlocking mechanism that goes beyond the conventional
    'slide to unlock' method. Combining gesture-based inputs with an animated 
    feedback system, the customized Planetary Combination Interface offers users
    a captivating and secure method to unlock their mobile devices. This interface
    ensures that only the correct planetary order combination can unlock the device,
    thereby enhancing user security and engagement.</p>
  <h5>Interface Logic</h5>
  <p>The "Planetary Combination Unlock Interface" operates as an innovative and
    engaging unlocking mechanism for mobile devices. Upon the initial setup, 
    the user selects a unique combination of planets in a specific order, creating 
    a personalized unlocking sequence. The interface background features a display of
    nine planets, and the user's preset combination dictates the particular sequence in
    which the planets must be selected to unlock the device.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the interface works:
  </p>
  <p>
    1.	Initialization: When the mobile device screen is activated, the user is presented 
    with the interface's planetary background, displaying all nine planets in a visually 
    appealing arrangement.
  </p>
  <p>
    2.	User Interaction: The user must interact with the interface by tapping on the planets
    in the correct predetermined order. This interaction relies on the user's prior setup of 
    the specific planet sequence required for unlocking.
  </p>
  <p>
    3.	Input Validation: As the user taps on each planet, the interface verifies whether the
    selection corresponds to the preset sequence. If the selected planet aligns with the predetermined
    next planet in the sequence, the interface provides visual feedback to indicate successful recognition.
  </p>
  <p>
    4.	Error Handling: In the event of an incorrect planet selection, the interface does not provide audio
    feedback indicating the recognition of the erroneous input. This approach ensures that accidental taps 
    or incorrect sequences do not trigger any indication of progress toward unlocking the device.
  </p>
  <p>
    5.	Completion and Unlocking: Once the user successfully selects all the planets in the correct order, 
    the interface initiates a final animation or transition, symbolizing the completion of the unlocking 
    process. This animation serves as a conclusive confirmation that the correct sequence has been followed, 
    leading to the device's successful unlocking.
  </p>
  <p>
    By implementing this intuitive and secure unlocking mechanism, the Planetary Combination Interface 
    emphasizes the importance of user-specific sequences while integrating engaging visual and auditory feedback to 
    enhance the overall user experience. Additionally, the interface's stringent error handling mechanisms 
    reinforce the necessity of accuracy and precision in executing the designated unlocking sequence.
  </p>
  
  <h5>Initial 10 Sketches</h5>
  <p>Each team member was asked to sketch out 10 ideas that they believe could be 
    suitable for an innovative and novel interface. We then discussed each idea 
    thoroughly and brainstormed new features that could be added to the original idea. 
    At the end, we decided that “Planetary Combination” is the idea that best suits the
    project’s rubric and has the most prospects for success while being implementable 
    given the short timeline.</p>
  <h5>Refined 10 Sketches</h5>
  <p>After agreeing that the “Planetary Combination” idea had the most prospect for 
    innovation and success, each team member created 10 refined sketches that matched
    their vision of the interface. We then discussed all the designs, and decided on 
    the interface layout and the feasible features that could be implemented given our 
    short timeline. </p>

  <ol>
    <li>User can drag the planets in their correct order to a specific button to unlock the phone</li>
    <li>User will be promted with a planet set where they can click the planets in the correct order.</li>
    <li>User will have the planets set up as a normal iphone number passcode where they also need to click it in the right order</li>
    <li>Users will be given a set of planets where they need to choose only 3 planets to put them in three boxes to unlock the phone.</li>
    <li>Custom Look: Users can create a custom look to planets to change their size, shape, color, or design as well as adding moons or rings.</li>
    <li>Info Planets: Users can create special and unique facts about their planets.</li>
    <li>Spaceship Tap: When a user taps a planet, a space ship travels to where the user tapped.</li>
    <li>Add Aliens to Planets: Users can add a cute little alien to their planet.</li>
    <li>Exploding Planets: If I user gets a password wrong, all planets explode in a cool animation.</li>
    <li>Design Your Astronaut: Users can make their own astronaut avatar.</li>
  </ol>
  

  <h5>What makes our interface special?</h5>
  <p>The Planetary Combination Interface stands out due to its unique blend of several distinctive features, making it a creative alternative to conventional unlocking methods. 
    Some of the key aspects that makes this interface special include:</p>
  <p>
1.	Personalized Security: Unlike standard unlock patterns or PIN codes, the Planetary Combination Interface allows users to create a personalized unlocking sequence based on their chosen planetary order. 
    This personalized approach adds an extra layer of security, as the unlocking process becomes highly specific to the individual user.</p>
  <p>
2.	Engaging Visual Experience: The interface employs a visually captivating display of planetary objects, offering an aesthetically pleasing and engaging backdrop for the unlocking process. 
    The interactive animations and auditory feedback provide an immersive and enjoyable user experience, making the unlocking process more than just a security checkpoint but an engaging interaction.
  </p>
  <p>
    3.	Intuitive Feedback Mechanism: Through its responsive feedback system, the interface offers real-time visual and auditory feedback that confirms the recognition of the user's input. This assures users
    that their actions are being acknowledged and processed by the system. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
Overall, the Planetary Combination Interface distinguishes itself through its fusion of personalization, engagement, and security, offering users a novel and captivating unlocking experience that goes beyond the standard 'slide to unlock' approach.
</p>
  <h5>Project contribution:</h5>
  <p>Our team's success in this project was the result of a coordinated effort, with each member playing a crucial role. When it came to sketching out our initial ideas, each team member prepared their own ideas, then we brainstormed, refined, and 
    collaborated to bring our creative visions to life. Simon graciously set up the initial react app and added the visual and auditory feedback system. Whereas Hala and Katie implemented the interface logic. Nayera’s writing skills allowed the 
    team to present informative write-ups that effectively communicated the essence of our project. For the demo, Hala and Nayera brought the unlocking interface to life with their enthusiasm and acting skills. Together, we combined our strengths 
    and talents to deliver an innovative and engaging application in a short period of time.</p>
