  <h5>Overview</h5>
  <p>Our primary goal for this project was to create a physical prototype to solve 
    an everyday problem with at least one output and input device. In pursuit of this
    objective, we designed a smart system that aids in optimizing plant growth conditions. 
    The system incorporates sensors to measure crucial environmental factors such as temperature
    , humidity, and light intensity. By integrating these inputs, the system provides feedback to
    users through a combination of sensory outputs, specifically a buzzing sound, indicating the 
    ideal location for placing a plant. This smart innovative system alleviates the common daily 
    challenge people encounter when aiming to ensure optimal and healthy growth of their plants. 
    This system stands out due to its ability to dynamically monitor key environmental factors 
    in real-time, providing timely feedback to guide users in identifying the perfect spot for their plants. 
</p>
  <h5>System Logic</h5>
    <p>
    The smart system aims to assist users in determining the perfect spot for their plants to flourish. 
      Initially, users are required to research and set the necessary conditions that foster the optimal 
      growth for their specific plant species. The system then tracks temperature, humidity, and light 
      intensity until it identifies the ideal environment. Once the ideal temperature, humidity, and light
      intensity are detected, the buzzer is triggered to alert the user to halt plant movement. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Key Components: 
    </p>
    <p>
    1. DHT sensor: Measures temperature and humidity levels in the environment.
    </p>
    <p>
    2. LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) / Photoresistor: Measures light intensity.
    </p>
    <p>3. Buzzer: Acts as an output device to signal the user when optimal plant growth conditions are detected.</p>
    
   <p> 4. Arduino microcontroller: Facilitates the integration of sensor data and controls the feedback mechanism.</p> 
    

  
  <h5>Initial 10 Sketches</h5>
  <p>Each team member was asked to sketch out 10 ideas that they believe could be suitable for an 
    engaging and novel physical prototype. We then discussed each idea thoroughly and brainstormed new 
    features that could be added to the original idea. At the end, we decided that “OptiGrow Companion” is 
    the idea that best suits the project’s rubric and has the most prospects for success while being implementable 
    given the short timeline.
</p>

  <h5>Refined 10 Sketches</h5>
  <p>After agreeing that the “OptiGrow Companion” idea had the most prospect for innovation and success, each 
    team member created 10 refined sketches that matched their vision of the smart system. We then discussed all 
    the designs, and decided on the feasible features of the system that could be implemented given our short timeline.

    <li>User can drag the planets in their correct order to a specific button to unlock the phone</li>
    <li>User will be promted with a planet set where they can click the planets in the correct order.</li>
    <li>User will have the planets set up as a normal iphone number passcode where they also need to click it in the right order</li>
    <li>Users will be given a set of planets where they need to choose only 3 planets to put them in three boxes to unlock the phone.</li>
    <li>Custom Look: Users can create a custom look to planets to change their size, shape, color, or design as well as adding moons or rings.</li>
    <li>Info Planets: Users can create special and unique facts about their planets.</li>
    <li>Spaceship Tap: When a user taps a planet, a space ship travels to where the user tapped.</li>
    <li>Add Aliens to Planets: Users can add a cute little alien to their planet.</li>
    <li>Exploding Planets: If I user gets a password wrong, all planets explode in a cool animation.</li>
    <li>Design Your Astronaut: Users can make their own astronaut avatar.</li>
  </ol>
  

  <h5>What makes our system special?</h5>

  <p>
    Unlike conventional methods that rely solely on static guidelines, this system dynamically assesses 
    the immediate surroundings in real-time, ensuring a precise evaluation of the plant's habitat. What sets
    this system apart is its user-centric design. It empowers individuals by not only offering data-driven 
    insights but also by guiding them through a sensory feedback mechanism. By emitting a distinctive buzzing
    sound when optimal conditions are detected, the system creates an interactive and intuitive experience for
    users. This auditory cue signifies the opportune moment to place the plant, eliminating the guesswork and 
    allowing for a seamless and informed decision-making process.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In essence, the integration of real-time monitoring, personalized guidance, and user interaction elevates 
    this system beyond a mere monitoring tool. It transforms plant care into an engaging and informed experience, 
    offering an innovative solution that simplifies the complexities of nurturing plants while promoting their healthy growth and well-being.
</p>

  <h5>Project contribution:</h5>
  <p>Our team's success in this project was the result of a coordinated effort, with each member playing a 
    crucial role. When it came to sketching out our initial ideas, each team member prepared their own ideas, 
    then we brainstormed, refined, and collaborated to bring our creative visions to life. As a team, we successfully 
    assembled the smart system using an Arduino kit and various sensors, then developed the code that brings our idea 
    to life. Nayera’s writing skills allowed the team to present informative write-ups that effectively communicated 
    the essence of our project. For the concept video and demo, Hala and Nayera brought the smart system to life with 
    their enthusiasm and acting skills. 
    Together, we combined our strengths and talents to deliver an innovative and engaging application in a short period of time.
